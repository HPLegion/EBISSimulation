Energy scans
============

Occasionally it may be interesting to see, what kind of impact the electron beam energy has
on the charge state distribution emerging after a given time. For this purpose, ebisim offers
an energy scan feature.

An interesting example may for example be to scan across the ionisation threshold of a certain
charge state, e.g. the ionisation of potassium 17+ to 18+ opens up at approximately 4.6 keV.

Another example, which provides structure that is a bit more interesting, is the sweep over the
KLL-type dielectronic recombination resonances of potassium.
