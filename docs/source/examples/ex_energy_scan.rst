Energy scans
============

Occasionally it may be interesting to see, what kind of impact the electron beam energy has
on the charge state distribution emerging after a given time. For this purpose ebisim offers
an energy scan feature.

An interesting example may for example be to scan accross the ionisation threshold of a certain
charge state. E.g. the ionisation of potassium 17+ to 18+ opens up at approximately 4.6 keV.

Another example which provides a bit more interesting structure is the sweep over the KLL-type
dielectronic resonance of potassium.
