# Credit for the resource Data

The EBIS simulations partially rely on physics simulations performed by others.

## Binding Energies

The tables for the binding energies and the electron configuration of ions in different charge
states have been created with the help of FAC by Robert Mertzig as part of his PhD Thesis at CERN

## DRDataKLLGroundState

The data has been derived from FAC simulations performed by Steffen KÃ¼hn as part of his work at
MPIK Heidelberg
