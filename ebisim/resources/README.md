# Resources

## Info

The resources in this directory are partially generated with the scripts found in the
[dev directory](../../dev/) and optimised for simple and efficient import. The dev directory
contains the data and scripts in a more human friendly form.

## Credit for the resource Data

Some of the data used within the ebisim package has been provided by 3rd parties.

### Binding Energies

The tables for the binding energies and the electron configuration of ions in different charge
states have been created with the help of the flexible-atomic-code
[FAC](https://github.com/flexible-atomic-code/fac) by Robert Mertzig
as part of his PhD Thesis.

The raw data can be retrieved from the
[project page](https://project-ionpotentials.web.cern.ch/project-Ionpotentials/).
